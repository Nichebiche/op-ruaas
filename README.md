# Opruaas - Optimism Rollup as a service

Optimism Rollup As A Service. Easily deploy and manage rollups with the Optimism stack.

In particular we provide:

- A [`cli`](packages/cli) for creating, testing, managing and deploying rollups.
- A [`marketplace`](packages/marketplace) for those users who don't want to get involved in running infrastructure and prefer to buy a service from a vendor.
- A [`console`](packages/console) for managing deployments and orders.

You'll find a `README.md` in each package to get started and know more details about them. Also you can go to `docs` to learn more about the project itself.
