# Milestone B: Decentralized marketplace

In Milestone B, we developed a decentralized marketplace to facilitate customer-vendor interactions. The implementation includes smart contracts for subscription payments and customer protection mechanisms. We built a vendor-deployable dApp enabling customers to purchase rollup services, including sequencers for new and existing chains, as well as replicas for established chains. Additionally, we enhanced the CLI to support both sequencer and replica deployments. The milestone also introduces a key reset feature for vendor changes and a user interface for managing vendor permissions.
